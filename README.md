# Udacity Blog Post - COVID-19 vs USA

## Libraries Used
- Pandas - Used for wrangling data
- Numpy - Used for wrangling data
- Matplotlib - Used to create charts
- sklearn - Used for prediction model

## Project Motivation
With COVID-19 being the topic on everyone's minds lately, I wanted to see what analysis I could do with the publicly available data from JHU. I was also curious to see if there was enough data for a basic prediction model to predict the next day's infection reports.

## Files in Project
Everything can be accessed via the Jupyter Notebook file entitled "COVID-19 Investigation for Iran, Italy, USA.ipynb"
